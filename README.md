## Features

### Authentication (v0.11.5)

ECM includes a comprehensive authentication system to secure access to your channel management:

- **First-Run Setup** - On first launch, create an administrator account through a setup wizard
- **Local Authentication** - Username/password authentication with secure bcrypt password hashing
- **Dispatcharr SSO** - Single sign-on using your existing Dispatcharr credentials
- **Account Linking** - Link multiple authentication methods to a single user account (e.g., local + Dispatcharr)
- **Password Reset** - Email-based password reset with secure time-limited tokens (requires SMTP configuration)
- **CLI Password Reset** - Reset passwords from the command line when locked out (see [Utility Scripts](#utility-scripts))
- **User Management** - Admin panel for managing user accounts, roles, and access
- **Session Management** - JWT-based sessions with automatic token refresh

#### Authentication Providers

- **Local** - Create and manage local user accounts with password authentication
- **Dispatcharr** - Authenticate using your Dispatcharr server credentials (SSO)

#### User Management (Admin)

Administrators can manage users through Settings → Users:
- View all user accounts with their roles and status
- Edit user email, display name, admin status, and active status
- Activate/deactivate user accounts
- Delete user accounts (soft delete - deactivates the account)

#### Password Reset

When SMTP is configured in Settings → Email Settings:
- Users see "Forgot password?" link on the login page
- Password reset emails contain a secure link valid for 1 hour
- Professional HTML email template with fallback plain text
- Security: Always returns success to prevent email enumeration

#### CLI Password Reset

When locked out or SMTP is not configured, reset passwords from the command line:
```bash
# Interactive mode (lists users, prompts for password)
docker exec -it enhancedchannelmanager python /app/reset_password.py

# Non-interactive (for scripting)
docker exec enhancedchannelmanager python /app/reset_password.py -u admin -p 'NewPass123'

# Skip password strength validation
docker exec enhancedchannelmanager python /app/reset_password.py -u admin -p 'simple' --force
```

### Auto-Creation Pipeline (v0.12.0)

## Utility Scripts

### Password Reset Script

The `reset_password.py` utility allows you to reset user passwords from the command line when locked out or when SMTP is not configured:

```bash
# Interactive mode — lists users, prompts for everything
docker exec -it enhancedchannelmanager python /app/reset_password.py

# Non-interactive — specify username and password
docker exec enhancedchannelmanager python /app/reset_password.py -u admin -p 'NewPass123'

# Semi-interactive — specify username, prompt for password securely
docker exec -it enhancedchannelmanager python /app/reset_password.py -u admin

# Skip password strength validation
docker exec enhancedchannelmanager python /app/reset_password.py -u admin -p 'simple' --force
```

**Features:**
- Interactive mode shows a table of all users with username, email, admin status, active status, and auth provider
- Password strength validation (8+ chars, upper/lower/digit) with `--force` to bypass
- Secure password prompts (not echoed to terminal)
- Warns when resetting password for non-local auth users
- Uses bcrypt with 12 rounds, matching the web UI authentication system

### Search Stream Script

The `scripts/search-stream.sh` utility allows you to search for streams in Dispatcharr via the command line:

```bash
# Make executable
chmod +x scripts/search-stream.sh

# Search for a stream
./scripts/search-stream.sh http://dispatcharr:9191 admin password "HBO Max HD"

# Search with special characters
./scripts/search-stream.sh http://dispatcharr:9191 admin password "[PPV EVENT 38]"

# Search partial name
./scripts/search-stream.sh http://dispatcharr:9191 admin password "ESPN"
```

**Features:**
- Handles authentication automatically
- URL-encodes special characters and spaces
- Returns pretty-printed JSON results
- Supports searching across all M3U accounts

**Extract specific fields:**
```bash
# Get just name and ID
./scripts/search-stream.sh http://dispatcharr:9191 admin pass "HBO" | jq '.results[] | {id, name}'

# Get count of results
./scripts/search-stream.sh http://dispatcharr:9191 admin pass "ESPN" | jq '.count'
```
