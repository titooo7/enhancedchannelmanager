# Dispatcharr Manager Next

A professional-grade web interface for managing IPTV configurations with Dispatcharr. Features a tab-based interface for channel management, EPG data, logos, and more. Built with React + TypeScript frontend and Python FastAPI backend.

## Application Tabs

- **Channel Manager** - Full-featured channel and stream management with split-pane layout
- **EPG Manager** - EPG data management (coming soon)
- **Logo Manager** - Logo management (coming soon)
- **Settings** - Configure Dispatcharr connection and preferences

## Features

### Channel Management

- **Create, Edit, Delete Channels** - Full CRUD operations for channel management
- **Channel Numbering** - Assign channel numbers (including decimal numbers like 4.1)
- **Auto-Rename** - Optionally update channel names when numbers change (e.g., "101 | Sports Channel" becomes "102 | Sports Channel")
- **Channel Groups** - Organize channels into groups for better organization
- **Delete Groups** - Delete channel groups with option to also delete contained channels
- **Bulk Delete** - Select multiple channels and delete them at once
- **Search & Filter** - Search channels by name, filter by one or more groups
- **Inline Stream Display** - View assigned streams directly in the channel list

### Stream Management

- **View Available Streams** - Browse all streams from your M3U providers
- **Assign Streams to Channels** - Drag-and-drop or click to add streams
- **Stream Priority** - Reorder streams within a channel (order determines playback priority)
- **Multi-Select** - Select multiple streams and bulk-add to channels
- **Filter by Provider** - Filter streams by M3U account
- **Filter by Group** - Filter streams by their source group

### Bulk Channel Creation

- **Create from Stream Group** - Create multiple channels from an entire M3U stream group at once
- **Auto-Assign Streams** - Each created channel automatically gets its source stream assigned
- **Merge Duplicate Names** - Streams with identical names from different M3U providers are merged into a single channel with all streams assigned (provides multi-provider redundancy)
- **Quality Variant Normalization** - Streams with quality suffixes (FHD, UHD, HD, SD, 4K, 1080P, etc.) are automatically merged into one channel
- **East/West Timezone Preference** - When streams have regional variants (e.g., "Movies Channel" and "Movies Channel West"), choose to create East feeds only, West feeds only, or keep both as separate channels
- **Country Prefix Removal** - Option to remove country prefixes (US, UK, CA, etc.) from channel names (e.g., "US: Sports Channel" becomes "Sports Channel")
- **Channel Number Prefix** - Option to prepend channel numbers to names with configurable separator (-, :, or |), e.g., "100 | Sports Channel"
- **Custom Starting Number** - Choose the starting channel number for sequential assignment
- **Flexible Group Options** - Create in same-named group, select existing group, or create new group
- **Preview Before Creating** - See a preview of channels that will be created with merged stream counts
- **Edit Mode Integration** - Requires edit mode, button visible on stream group headers on hover

### Edit Mode (Staged Editing)

A unique workflow that lets you stage changes locally before committing to the server:

- **Enter Edit Mode** - Start a new editing session
- **Stage Changes** - All edits are queued locally (including deletes)
- **Preview Changes** - See pending operations count
- **Local Undo/Redo** - Undo/redo within your edit session (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z)
- **Undoable Deletes** - Channel and group deletions can be undone before committing
- **Batch Operations** - Group related changes together
- **Commit or Discard** - Apply all changes at once or discard everything
- **Exit Dialog** - Review a summary of all changes before committing
- **Modified Indicators** - Visual highlighting of channels with pending changes

### Drag and Drop

- **Add Streams** - Drag streams onto channels to add them
- **Bulk Add** - Drag multiple selected streams at once
- **Reorder Channels** - Drag channels to reorder within a group (edit mode)
- **Move Between Groups** - Drag channels to different groups with confirmation modal
- **Reorder Streams** - Drag to reorder streams within a channel
- **Visual Feedback** - Drop indicators and highlighting

### Multi-Select Channels

- **Ctrl/Cmd + Click** - Toggle individual channel selection
- **Shift + Click** - Select range of channels
- **Visual Indicators** - Selection checkboxes and highlighting
- **Bulk Operations** - Move or modify multiple channels at once

### Sort & Renumber

- **Alphabetical Sorting** - Sort channels within a group A-Z
- **Sequential Renumbering** - Assign sequential numbers starting from any value
- **Smart Name Sorting** - Option to ignore channel numbers in names when sorting (e.g., "101 | Sports Channel" sorts as "Sports Channel")
- **Preview** - See the result before applying
- **Batch Undo** - Entire sort/renumber operation undoes as one action

### Logo Management
