## Features

### Authentication (v0.11.5)

ECM includes a comprehensive authentication system to secure access to your channel management:

- **First-Run Setup** - On first launch, create an administrator account through a setup wizard
- **Local Authentication** - Username/password authentication with secure bcrypt password hashing
- **Dispatcharr SSO** - Single sign-on using your existing Dispatcharr credentials
- **Account Linking** - Link multiple authentication methods to a single user account (e.g., local + Dispatcharr)
- **Password Reset** - Email-based password reset with secure time-limited tokens (requires SMTP configuration)
- **CLI Password Reset** - Reset passwords from the command line when locked out (see [Utility Scripts](#utility-scripts))
- **User Management** - Admin panel for managing user accounts, roles, and access
- **Session Management** - JWT-based sessions with automatic token refresh

#### Authentication Providers

- **Local** - Create and manage local user accounts with password authentication
- **Dispatcharr** - Authenticate using your Dispatcharr server credentials (SSO)

#### User Management (Admin)

Administrators can manage users through Settings → Users:
- View all user accounts with their roles and status
- Edit user email, display name, admin status, and active status
- Activate/deactivate user accounts
- Delete user accounts (soft delete - deactivates the account)

#### Password Reset

When SMTP is configured in Settings → Email Settings:
- Users see "Forgot password?" link on the login page
- Password reset emails contain a secure link valid for 1 hour
- Professional HTML email template with fallback plain text
- Security: Always returns success to prevent email enumeration

#### CLI Password Reset

When locked out or SMTP is not configured, reset passwords from the command line:
```bash
# Interactive mode (lists users, prompts for password)
docker exec -it enhancedchannelmanager python /app/reset_password.py

# Non-interactive (for scripting)
docker exec enhancedchannelmanager python /app/reset_password.py -u admin -p 'NewPass123'

# Skip password strength validation
docker exec enhancedchannelmanager python /app/reset_password.py -u admin -p 'simple' --force
```

### Auto-Creation Pipeline (v0.12.0)

A rules-based automation engine for automatic channel creation, stream merging, and lifecycle management:

#### Rule Builder
- **Create Rules** - Define automation rules with conditions, actions, and priority ordering
- **Rule Priority** - Drag-and-drop reordering to control execution order
- **Enable/Disable** - Toggle individual rules without deleting
- **Duplicate Rules** - Clone rules as a starting point for new rules
- **Run on M3U Refresh** - Optionally auto-execute rules when M3U accounts refresh
- **Stop on First Match** - Stop evaluating further rules when a stream matches
- **Normalize Names** - Apply name normalization during processing
- **YAML Import/Export** - Share and version control rule definitions

#### Conditions
Build complex matching logic with AND/OR connectors:
- **Stream Name** - Contains, matches (regex), starts/ends with
- **Stream Group** - Contains, matches (regex)
- **TVG ID** - Exists/not exists, matches pattern
- **Logo** - Exists/not exists
- **M3U Account** - Filter by specific M3U account
- **Quality** - Minimum/maximum resolution (2160p, 1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p)
- **Codec** - Filter by video codec (H.264, HEVC, etc.)
- **Channel Exists** - Check if channel already exists (by name, regex, or group)
- **Normalized Match in Group** - Check if a stream's normalized name matches any channel in a specified channel group (strips country prefixes and applies normalization engine)
- **Normalized Name (Global)** - Check if a stream's normalized name matches any channel across all groups
- **Normalized Name (Not In)** - Check if a stream's normalized name does NOT match any channel in a specified group
- **Date Expansion in Regex** - Regex conditions can include date patterns that auto-expand to match current dates (contributed by @lpukatch)

#### Actions
Define what happens when conditions match:
- **Create Channel** - Template-based naming with variables (`{stream_name}`, `{stream_group}`, `{quality}`, `{provider}`, etc.)
- **Create Group** - Automatically create channel groups with template naming
- **Merge Streams** - Combine multiple streams into a single channel with quality preference ordering, optional per-provider stream limit, and multi-stage auto-lookup (exact name → core-name fallback → call sign fallback → deparen/word-prefix matching)
- **Remove From Channel** - Remove a stream from its current channel during auto-creation
- **Set Stream Priority** - Set stream priority/weight within a channel
- **Assign Logo/EPG/Profile** - Automatically assign channel metadata
- **Set Channel Number** - Auto-assign or specify channel numbering (including ranges)
- **Set Variable** - Define reusable variables with regex extraction for use in templates
- **Name Transform** - Apply regex find/replace to channel names
- **If Exists Behavior** - Skip, merge (create if new), merge only (existing only), update, or use existing when channels already exist

#### Execution
- **Dry Run Mode** - Preview all changes before applying
- **Execute Mode** - Apply changes with full audit trail
- **Run Single Rule** - Execute or dry-run a specific rule in isolation
- **Rollback** - Undo a completed execution to restore previous state
- **Execution History** - View past runs with duration, match counts, and created/updated/merged/skipped counts
- **Running Indicator** - Live "Running" status in execution history while a pipeline is executing
- **Execution Log** - Per-stream granular log showing condition evaluation, matched rules, action results, normalization context, and merge guidance with filter chips for quick navigation

#### Smart Stream Handling
- **Quality-Based Sorting** - Sort streams within channels by resolution (highest first)
- **Probe on Sort** - Optionally probe unprobed streams for resolution data before sorting
- **Multi-Criteria Sort** - Sort by stream name, natural name, group, quality, or stream name (regex)
- **Stream Name (Regex) Sort** - Sort matched streams by a regex capture group extracted from the stream name (e.g., sort by date pattern `(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})`)
- **Auto-Find Channels** - Merge streams action with `target: auto` automatically finds existing channels using a multi-stage lookup: normalized name → core-name fallback (stripping tags) → call sign fallback → deparen and word-prefix matching. For example, "US: Discovery" finds channel "113 | Discovery", and "ESPN (East)" finds "ESPN"
- **User Settings Integration** - Honors channel numbering, default profile, timezone preference, and auto-rename settings

#### Orphan Reconciliation
Automatically manage channels that no longer match any rule:
- **Delete** - Remove orphaned channels entirely
- **Move to Uncategorized** - Preserve channels by moving them out of managed groups
- **Delete and Cleanup Groups** - Delete channels and remove now-empty groups
- **None** - Skip reconciliation (preserve all channels)

## Utility Scripts

### Password Reset Script

The `reset_password.py` utility allows you to reset user passwords from the command line when locked out or when SMTP is not configured:

```bash
# Interactive mode — lists users, prompts for everything
docker exec -it enhancedchannelmanager python /app/reset_password.py

# Non-interactive — specify username and password
docker exec enhancedchannelmanager python /app/reset_password.py -u admin -p 'NewPass123'

# Semi-interactive — specify username, prompt for password securely
docker exec -it enhancedchannelmanager python /app/reset_password.py -u admin

# Skip password strength validation
docker exec enhancedchannelmanager python /app/reset_password.py -u admin -p 'simple' --force
```

**Features:**
- Interactive mode shows a table of all users with username, email, admin status, active status, and auth provider
- Password strength validation (8+ chars, upper/lower/digit) with `--force` to bypass
- Secure password prompts (not echoed to terminal)
- Warns when resetting password for non-local auth users
- Uses bcrypt with 12 rounds, matching the web UI authentication system

### Search Stream Script

The `scripts/search-stream.sh` utility allows you to search for streams in Dispatcharr via the command line:

```bash
# Make executable
chmod +x scripts/search-stream.sh

# Search for a stream
./scripts/search-stream.sh http://dispatcharr:9191 admin password "HBO Max HD"

# Search with special characters
./scripts/search-stream.sh http://dispatcharr:9191 admin password "[PPV EVENT 38]"

# Search partial name
./scripts/search-stream.sh http://dispatcharr:9191 admin password "ESPN"
```

**Features:**
- Handles authentication automatically
- URL-encodes special characters and spaces
- Returns pretty-printed JSON results
- Supports searching across all M3U accounts

**Extract specific fields:**
```bash
# Get just name and ID
./scripts/search-stream.sh http://dispatcharr:9191 admin pass "HBO" | jq '.results[] | {id, name}'

# Get count of results
./scripts/search-stream.sh http://dispatcharr:9191 admin pass "ESPN" | jq '.count'
```
