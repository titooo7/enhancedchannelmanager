## Auto-Creation Pipeline

The Auto-Creation tab lets you automate channel creation with a rules-based engine. Define conditions to match streams and actions to create channels, merge streams, and assign metadata automatically.

### Creating a Rule

1. Click **Add Rule** in the Auto-Creation tab
2. Enter a **Rule Name** and optional **Description**
3. Configure **Conditions** to match streams
4. Configure **Actions** to define what happens
5. Click **Save**

### Conditions

Build matching logic using a three-part editor (Field + Operator + Value) with AND/OR connectors:

| Field | Operators |
|-------|-----------|
| **Stream Name** | contains, does not contain, begins with, ends with, matches (regex) |
| **Stream Group** | contains, matches (regex) |
| **TVG ID** | exists, does not exist, matches |
| **Logo** | exists, does not exist |
| **M3U Account** | is, is not (specific M3U account) |
| **Quality** | at least, at most (2160p, 1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p) |
| **Codec** | is, is not (H.264, HEVC, etc.) |
| **Channel Exists** | by name, regex, or group |
| **Normalized Match in Group** | stream's normalized name matches a channel in a specified group |
| **Normalized Name (Global)** | stream's normalized name matches any channel across all groups |
| **Normalized Name (Not In)** | stream's normalized name does NOT match any channel in a specified group |

#### AND/OR Connectors

Between each condition is a clickable **AND/OR toggle**. Click it to switch between AND and OR. Understanding how these work is important for building effective rules.

**AND** means "also require this." All conditions connected by AND must be true together for a match.

**OR** means "or alternatively match this." OR creates a separate group of conditions — if *any* OR-group fully matches, the stream matches the rule.

**Order of operations:** AND binds tighter than OR, just like multiplication before addition in math. Conditions connected by AND are grouped together first, then OR separates those groups.

**Example 1 — Simple AND (all must match):**

```
Stream Name contains "ESPN"  AND  Stream Group contains "US"
```
Matches only streams with "ESPN" in the name that are also in a "US" group. Both must be true.

**Example 2 — Simple OR (either can match):**

```
Stream Name contains "ESPN"  OR  Stream Name contains "Fox Sports"
```
Matches streams with either "ESPN" or "Fox Sports" in the name.

**Example 3 — Mixed AND/OR (order of operations):**

```
Stream Name contains "ESPN"  AND  Quality at least 1080p  OR  Stream Name contains "Fox Sports"  AND  Quality at least 720p
```
This is evaluated as two groups:
- **Group 1:** Stream Name contains "ESPN" **AND** Quality at least 1080p
- **Group 2:** Stream Name contains "Fox Sports" **AND** Quality at least 720p

A stream matches if *either* group fully matches. So "ESPN HD 1080p" matches via Group 1, and "Fox Sports 720p" matches via Group 2, but "ESPN 480p" does not match (fails Group 1's quality requirement, and doesn't match Group 2 at all).

**Example 4 — Common pattern for multi-provider merging:**

```
Normalized Match in Group = "Documentaries"  AND  Stream Group matches "^US"
```
Matches any stream from a US group whose normalized name matches a channel in your Documentaries channel group. Pair this with a `merge_streams(target: auto)` action to automatically merge matching streams into existing channels.

> **Tip:** Think of OR as creating separate "paths to match." Each path (AND-group) is evaluated independently. If you want "match A and B, or match C and D", place AND between A-B and between C-D, with OR between the two groups.

#### Normalized Match in Group

This condition type is particularly useful for merging streams into existing channels. It normalizes both the stream name (stripping country prefixes like "US:") and channel names (stripping number prefixes like "106 |") using the normalization engine, then checks if the normalized stream name matches any channel in the selected group. The group selector only shows channel groups that actually contain channels.

The **Global** variant checks against all channel groups at once, while the **Not In** variant inverts the match — useful for finding streams that don't yet have a corresponding channel.

#### Date Expansion in Regex

Regex conditions support date patterns that automatically expand to match current dates. For example, a pattern like `{date:YYYY-MM-DD}` in a regex condition will expand to match today's date. This is useful for matching streams that include dates in their names (e.g., PPV events). Date expansion supports patterns up to 90 days out to prevent regex overload. Contributed by @lpukatch.

### Actions

Define what happens when conditions match:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Create Channel** | Template-based naming using `{stream_name}`, `{stream_group}`, `{quality}`, `{provider}`, etc. |
| **Create Group** | Automatically create a channel group |
| **Merge Streams** | Combine multiple streams into one channel with quality preference; auto-find uses multi-stage lookup (normalized name → core-name → call sign → deparen/word-prefix); optional max streams per provider limit |
| **Assign Logo** | Set channel logo from stream or URL |
| **Assign EPG** | Assign EPG data source |
| **Assign Profile** | Set stream transcoding profile |
| **Set Channel Number** | Auto-assign or specify number/range |
| **Set Variable** | Define reusable variables with regex extraction |
| **Name Transform** | Apply regex find/replace to channel names |
| **Skip / Stop** | Skip stream or stop processing further rules |

When a channel already exists, choose behavior:
- **Skip** - Don't create the channel
- **Merge (create if new)** - Add streams to existing channel, or create a new one if no match found
- **Merge Only (existing only)** - Add streams to existing channel only; skip if no match (never creates new channels)
- **Update** - Update existing channel properties
- **Use Existing** - Use the existing channel without changes

### Rule Options

- **Priority** - Drag rules to reorder execution priority
- **Run on M3U Refresh** - Auto-execute when M3U accounts refresh
- **Stop on First Match** - Stop evaluating further rules when a stream matches
- **Normalize Names** - Apply name normalization during processing
- **Sort Field** - Sort matched streams by name, group, or quality
- **Probe on Sort** - Probe unprobed streams for resolution data before quality sorting

### Execution

**Dry Run** - Click **Dry Run** to preview what changes would occur without applying them. Review the execution results showing channels that would be created, streams that would be merged, and orphans that would be removed.

**Execute** - Click **Run** to apply all rule actions. The execution log shows per-stream details of condition evaluation, rule matching, action results, normalization context, and merge guidance. Use **filter chips** at the top of the log to quickly filter by result type (created, merged, skipped, etc.).

**Run Single Rule** - Execute or dry-run a specific rule in isolation from the rule's menu.

**Rollback** - Undo a completed execution from the execution history to restore the previous state.

**Execution History Summary** - Each execution in the history shows a quick summary: streams matched, channels merged, channels created, and streams skipped. A live "Running" indicator appears while a pipeline is executing.

**Auto-Find for Merge Streams** - When using the `merge_streams` action with `target: auto` and no explicit `find_channel_by`, the engine uses a multi-stage lookup to find existing channels:

1. **Normalized Name** - Strips country prefixes (e.g., "US: Discovery" → "Discovery") and matches against channel names that may have number prefixes (e.g., "113 | Discovery")
2. **Core-Name Fallback** - If no match, strips all tags from the stream name and tries again
3. **Call Sign Fallback** - If still no match, compares against channel call signs from EPG data
4. **Deparen/Word-Prefix** - Strips parenthetical suffixes (e.g., "ESPN (East)" → "ESPN") and tries word-prefix matching

This means you can set up a simple rule with `normalized_name_in_group` + `merge_streams(target: auto)` to automatically merge streams from any provider into your existing channel lineup without manual channel-by-channel mapping.

**Max Streams Per Provider** - The merge_streams action supports an optional `max_streams_per_provider` setting that limits how many streams from a single M3U account can be merged into a channel. This prevents one provider from dominating a channel's stream list and is enforced against both newly-added and existing streams.

### Orphan Reconciliation

When a rule's conditions change and previously-matched streams no longer match, the channels they created become "orphans." Configure per-rule orphan handling:

| Action | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Delete** | Remove orphaned channels entirely |
| **Move to Uncategorized** | Move channels out of managed groups |
| **Delete & Cleanup Groups** | Delete channels and remove empty groups |
| **None** | Preserve all channels, skip reconciliation |

### Global Exclusion Filters

Configure stream exclusion filters in the Auto-Creation settings (gear icon at the top of the Auto-Creation tab):

- **M3U Group Dropdown** - Select which M3U groups to include in rule evaluation
- **Exclusion Patterns** - Define regex patterns to exclude streams before any rules are evaluated
- Exclusion filters apply globally to all rules, saving you from repeating the same exclusion conditions in every rule

### YAML Import/Export

- **Export** - Download all rules as YAML for backup or sharing
- **Import** - Paste YAML rule definitions to create rules
- Useful for version control and sharing configurations between instances

## FFMPEG Builder

The FFMPEG Builder tab provides a visual interface for constructing FFmpeg transcoding and streaming commands without writing command-line syntax. It's designed for IPTV streaming workflows but supports any FFmpeg use case.

### Simple Mode (IPTV Wizard)

![FFMPEG Simple Mode](docs/images/76-ffmpeg-simple-mode.png)
<!-- Screenshot: FFMPEG Builder in Simple Mode showing the three-step wizard: Source, Processing, Output -->

Simple mode is the default and is purpose-built for IPTV streaming:

**Step 1: Choose a Preset**

The preset bar at the top offers 8 optimized IPTV templates:

| Preset | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Pass-through** | Copy streams without re-encoding (fastest) |
| **IPTV Standard (H.264)** | Software encode for universal compatibility |
| **IPTV HD (NVIDIA)** | Hardware NVENC encoding for NVIDIA GPUs |
| **IPTV HD (Intel QSV)** | Hardware Quick Sync for Intel GPUs |
| **Low-Latency AC3** | Minimal latency with AC3 surround sound |
| **HLS Output** | Segmented HTTP Live Streaming format |
| **1080p / AAC** | Full HD software encode with stereo audio |
| **4K / AC3** | 4K HEVC with 5.1 surround sound |

Click any preset to load its configuration instantly.

**Step 2: Configure Source**

1. Enter the **Source URL** or use `{streamUrl}` for Dispatcharr runtime substitution
2. Choose the **Processing Mode** (codec/hardware)
3. Select the **Audio Codec** (AAC for compatibility, AC3 for surround)
4. Configure audio channels (stereo, 5.1, 7.1)

**Step 3: Set Output**

1. Choose **Output Format**: MPEG-TS (piping to Dispatcharr) or HLS (segmented streaming)
2. Enable/disable **Stream Options** for network resilience (auto-reconnect, buffer sizes)

> **Which should you choose?**
>
> **Choose MPEG-TS if:** You have a wired connection, a very stable ISP, and hate when your live TV is lagging behind the "real-time" broadcast.
>
> **Choose HLS if:** You are on WiFi, your ISP throttles traffic, you experience buffering, or you use catch-up features.
>
> **For Dispatcharr:** If the IPTV provider offers both, try HLS first for better stability. However, if your IPTV provider is solid and you want the fastest possible channel changing, try MPEG-TS.
>
> **Performance tip:** Matching your output format to your provider's source format (e.g., MPEG-TS in → MPEG-TS out) avoids container remuxing, which reduces CPU usage and latency. If your provider delivers MPEG-TS, prefer MPEG-TS output; if they deliver HLS, prefer HLS output.

### Advanced Mode

![FFMPEG Advanced Mode](docs/images/77-ffmpeg-advanced-mode.png)

4. See counts of active, disabled, and custom tags per group
5. Use **Reset to Defaults** to restore default configuration

These settings are pre-loaded as defaults in the bulk create modal, adjustable per-operation via the Quick Tag Manager.

### Stream Probing

![Probe Settings](docs/images/56-probe-settings.png)
<!-- Screenshot: Stream Probing settings showing: Enable toggle, Schedule (start time, interval), Performance limits, Channel group filter -->

Configure automated stream health checking:

1. **Enable** stream probing
2. Set **Start Time** (e.g., 03:00 for off-peak)
3. Set **Interval** (hours between probes)
4. Configure **Batch Size** and **Timeout**
5. Select **Channel Groups** to probe
6. Configure **Retry Settings** - Set how many times to retry failed probes before marking a stream as failed

#### Per-Account Ramp-Up

ECM gradually increases probe load per M3U account rather than hitting the provider with full concurrency immediately. This prevents triggering rate limits or connection blocks. The ramp-up starts conservatively and increases over time as probes succeed.

#### Probe Retry Coverage

Probes automatically retry on common transient failures:
- **Transient HTTP 200** - Server returns 200 but with invalid/empty data
- **I/O Errors** - Network timeouts, connection resets, and socket errors
- **"Invalid data found"** - ffprobe reports invalid data (often transient with live streams)

#### Stale Group Alerts

When channel groups have outdated probe data (e.g., probing was disabled or failed for an extended period), ECM generates notifications alerting you to re-probe those groups.

#### Profile-Aware Probing

When an M3U account has multiple profiles (configured in Dispatcharr), ECM automatically distributes probe connections across them. Each profile has its own max connection limit, and ECM rewrites stream URLs using the profile's search/replace patterns so probes go through the correct profile endpoint.

#### Profile Distribution Strategy

If any M3U account has multiple profiles, a **Profile Distribution Strategy** dropdown appears in Settings → Maintenance under "Enable parallel probing":

| Strategy | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Fill First** (default) | Uses the default profile until it reaches its connection limit, then spills over to the next profile. Best when you want to minimize the number of active profiles. |
| **Round Robin** | Rotates across profiles one at a time so each gets an equal share of probe connections. Good for spreading usage evenly. |
| **Least Loaded** | Picks the profile with the most remaining headroom (highest ratio of free connections). Best for maximizing throughput when profiles have different connection limits. |

This setting only affects probing — it does not change how Dispatcharr routes viewer traffic.

### Stream Strikeout System

The strikeout system helps you identify and clean up streams that consistently fail probe checks.

**How It Works:**
1. Each stream tracks its **consecutive probe failures** — the counter resets when a probe succeeds
2. When a stream exceeds the configurable **strike threshold** (set in Settings → Maintenance), it is flagged as "struck out"
3. **Strike badges** appear on struck-out streams in the Channel Manager, showing the failure count
4. Review all struck-out streams in **Settings → Maintenance** with details about each stream and its failure history
5. Use **Bulk Remove** to remove all struck-out streams from every channel they're assigned to in one click

This is useful for cleaning up dead or unreliable streams that accumulate over time, especially after provider changes or M3U updates.

### Stream Sort Priority

![Sort Priority](docs/images/57-sort-priority.png)
<!-- Screenshot: Sort Priority settings showing draggable criteria: Resolution, Bitrate, Framerate with toggle switches -->

1. Drag criteria to set priority order
2. Toggle individual criteria on/off
3. Enable "Deprioritize Failed Streams"

### Stream Preview Settings

Configure how streams and channels are previewed in the browser:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Passthrough** | Direct proxy, fastest but may fail on AC-3/E-AC-3/DTS audio |
| **Transcode** | FFmpeg transcodes audio to AAC for browser compatibility (recommended) |
| **Video Only** | Strip audio entirely for silent quick preview |

Change mode anytime; takes effect on the next preview.

### Channel Defaults

Default options pre-loaded when using bulk channel creation:

- **Default Channel Profile** - Stream profile for new channels
- **Auto-Rename on Number Change** - Update channel names when numbers change
- **Include Channel Number in Name** - Add number prefix (e.g., "101 - Sports Channel")
- **Number Separator** - Choose hyphen (-), colon (:), or pipe (|)
- **Remove Country Prefix** - Strip country codes from names (bulk create modal also offers "Keep" with normalized formatting)
- **Timezone Preference** - Default handling for East/West regional variants

These defaults appear in the bulk create modal with a "(from settings)" indicator.

### Appearance

- **Theme** - Dark (default), Light, or High Contrast
- **Show Stream URLs** - Toggle stream URL visibility (hide for screenshots)
- **Hide Auto-Sync Groups** - Auto-hide auto-sync channel groups on load (channels persist in ECM even when auto-sync is later disabled in Dispatcharr)

## Debug Logging

ECM uses structured log prefixes in square brackets to identify which subsystem produced each log message. When you enable debug logging (Settings > General > Log Level), these tags help you quickly filter and understand log output.

### How to Read Log Lines

Each log line follows this format:

```
2026-02-19 00:48:40,031 - auto_creation_engine - INFO - [AUTO-CREATE-ENGINE] Evaluating 15771 streams against 1 rules
^                         ^                      ^      ^                    ^
timestamp                 Python module           level  subsystem tag        message
```

The **subsystem tag** (e.g., `[AUTO-CREATE-ENGINE]`) tells you exactly which part of ECM generated the message. Use these tags to filter logs with `grep` or your log viewer.

### Filtering Logs

To view logs from a specific subsystem, use `grep` with the tag:

```bash
# View only auto-creation engine logs
docker logs ecm-ecm-1 2>&1 | grep "\[AUTO-CREATE-ENGINE\]"

# View all authentication-related logs
docker logs ecm-ecm-1 2>&1 | grep "\[AUTH"

# View slow requests
docker logs ecm-ecm-1 2>&1 | grep "\[SLOW-REQUEST\]"

# Follow logs in real time, filtered
docker logs -f ecm-ecm-1 2>&1 | grep "\[M3U\]"
```

## Tips & Best Practices

### Organizing Channels
- Use descriptive group names ("Sports", "News", "Movies")
- Set logical channel number ranges (100-199 Sports, 200-299 News)
- Keep related channels together

### Managing Providers
- Link accounts from the same provider
- Use smart merging for duplicate channels
- Set stream priorities (best quality first)

### Maintaining EPG
- Prioritize most reliable EPG sources
- Use dummy EPG for channels without guide data
- Schedule EPG refreshes during off-peak hours

### Monitoring Health
- Enable stream probing
- Configure alerts for failures
- Check Stats dashboard regularly
