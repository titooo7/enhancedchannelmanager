# Log injection (py/log-injection) is mitigated at runtime by a custom
# LogRecord factory in backend/log_utils.py that sanitizes all log arguments,
# escaping newlines and carriage returns before they reach the formatter.
# CodeQL's static analysis cannot trace through Python's logging framework
# internals, so we exclude this query to avoid false positives.
