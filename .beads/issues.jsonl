Phase 1: Tag Engine Backend (models, migration, API, built-in tags)\n2. Phase 2: Rules Engine Enhancement (tag_group condition, else logic)\n3. Phase 3: Tag Engine Frontend (TagEngineSection component)\n4. Phase 4: Rules Engine Frontend (enhanced rule editor)\n5. Phase 5: Migration \u0026 Testing\n6.

StreamsPane: Works with string[] group names directly\n   - Simple string array, no object structure\n   - Different sorting logic\n\nDUPLICATION EXISTS but contexts differ:\n- Search input + clear button (same)\n- Select All / Clear All buttons (same logic, different data types)\n- Checkbox list with filtering (same pattern, different item types)\n\nATTEMPTED SOLUTION:\nCreated useMultiSelectFilter hook with generic types to handle both:\n- TItem: the source items (ChannelGroup[] or string[])\n- TKey: the selected keys (number[] or string[])\n- getKey/getSearchableText callbacks for flexibility\n\nPROBLEM:\nThe hook becomes complex with generic types and callbacks, making it harder to understand than the inline implementations.
